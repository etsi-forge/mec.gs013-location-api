description: Period (in seconds) of time notifications are provided for. If set to "0" (zero), a default duration time, which is specified by the service policy, will be used. If the parameter is omitted, the notifications will continue until the maximum duration time, which is specified by the service policy, unless the notifications are stopped by deletion of subscription for notifications. This element MAY be given by the client during resource creation in order to signal the desired lifetime of the subscription. The server MUST return in this element the period of time for which the subscription will still be valid.
